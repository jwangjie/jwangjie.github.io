## I am actively recruiting master's and PhD students! ##
### If you are interested in joining my lab, please apply by sending your CV (2 pages max) titled "RAL2025-Application" to my email address at [j.wang@umanitoba.ca](mailto:j.wang@umanitoba.ca). ###

### Please note, due to a high volume of inquiries, I will only respond to candidates of interest. I read all my emails, including those in the junk folder. If you do not receive a reply within two weeks, please assume there will be no further response. ###

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Manitoba, where I direct the Robot Autonomy Lab. My research focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous systems and mobile robotics. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques with traditional model-based robotic methodologies, I aim to develop advanced algorithms that ensure the operational safety of autonomous systems in unstructured and dynamic environments.

I received my PhD in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, specializing in robotics control, from the University of Calgary. My doctoral research focused on the locomotion mode selection and motion planning of a leg-tracked quadrupedal robot. Prior to my current position, I was a Research Associate at Concordia University, working on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wildfire detection and fighting. I also worked as a Research Associate at the University of Waterloo, developing a safe learning-based control framework for mixed-vehicle platooning control. Additionally, I served as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Queenâ€™s University, proposing a high-performance path-following algorithm for ground mobile robots, and at the University of Calgary, developing robust multi-vehicle tracking algorithms for UAVs.

Throughout my career, I aim to push the boundaries of robotics and autonomous systems, leveraging the strengths of both machine learning and model-based control to address real-world challenges.
