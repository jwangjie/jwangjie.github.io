## Abstract
Multi-modal locomotion (e.g. terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic) is gaining increasing interest
in robotics research as it improves the robots’ environmental adaptability, locomotion versatility,
and operational flexibility. Within the terrestrial multiple locomotion robots, the advantage
of hybrid robots stems from their multiple (two or more) locomotion modes, among which robots
can select from depending on the encountering terrain conditions. However, there are many challenges
in improving the autonomy of the locomotion mode transition between their multiple locomotion
modes.

This work proposed a method to realize an autonomous locomotion mode transition of a tracklegged quadruped 
robot’s steps negotiation. The autonomy of the decision-making process was
realized by the proposed criterion to comparing energy performances of the rolling and walking
locomotion modes. Two climbing gaits were proposed to achieve smooth steps negotiation behaviours
for the energy evaluation purposes. Simulations showed autonomous locomotion mode transitions
were realized for negotiations of steps with different height. The proposed method is generic enough
to be utilized to other hybrid robots after some pre-studies of their locomotion’s energy performances.
