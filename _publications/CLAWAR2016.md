## Abstract
This paper proposes a criterion based method to make possible the autonomous locomotion
mode transition of ground hybrid robots. The criterion is developed based on both the
internal states of robots (energy) and the external environmental information (obstacle
height), which has been verified via the energy consumption comparison of two simplified
locomotion models of rolling and walking locomotion. A method to determine the
conditions under which locomotion transition should be performed is also discussed.
Compared with current studies in this area, the novelty of the proposed method lies on
considering external environmental information in developing the transition criterion,
comparing and evaluating the alternative locomotion performance to determine the
criterion threshold, and developing criteria based on generalizable robot parameters rather
than particular designs, thus the proposed method can be implemented on various hybrid
robots.
